I was searching for a software developer/engineer position at startups with an office based in Toronto from September through December 2020.

I submitted many applications to companies I found interesting. A number of them got back to me and here I am listing them with aliased names:

- `A`: In social media marketing. I was referred by an employee there.
- `B`: In messaging platform business. I was referred by an employee there.
- `C`: In travel business.
- `D`: In content streaming. I cancelled my interview here after hearing lots of negative comments about them.
- `E`: In food ordering and delivery. I was hired here.
- `F`: In book and content selling.
- `G`: In crypto currency business.
- `H`: In personal finance.

Here's the timeline showing what happened:

|                             | September  | October    | November   | December   |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Application**             | `A_______` | `_BCD____` | `________` | `____E___` |
| **Recruiter Screen**        | `________` | `_B______` | `___D____` | `_____F__` |
| **Manager Screen**          | `________` | `ABC_____` | `________` | `____E_GH` |
| **Coding Assignment**       | `________` | `________` | `__C_____` | `________` |
| **Coding Interview**        | `________` | `_B______` | `__C_____` | `____E___` |
| **Culture Fit Interview**   | `________` | `________` | `________` | `____E___` |
| **System Design Interview** | `________` | `________` | `________` | `____E___` |

As you might have guessed, most of the September month was spent on learning about the interview process and working on my resume.

> NOTE: I only compiled these ideas to make it work for me. I got a ton of advice from friends, family, and people on the Internet to arrive at some of these practices.

## Job Postings

- Hacker News postings. There are sites that make it easier to query them such as https://www.hnhiring.me/
- Angel.co: Good for startups. Most of them have the salary and detailed company info posted on them too.
- LinkedIn job: I noticed some of job postings on LinkedIn have more details on them than the same jobs posted on other platforms.
- Indeed: Didn't like it. Most of the jobs were contract positions. It also kept spamming my inbox.

## Applications

I included a _cover letter_ to show I am interested in the company and also believe that I am a good match for the job.
It's not really a letter though. I had two separate paragraphs that I was using for most of applications and kept changing the company name in the sentence.

After seeing a job posting in any position from a startup, I looked the company up on LinkedIn. My first criterion was the size of company being above 50 employees. I then went directly to their careers page on the official company website and looked for their job postings to see if there is any that interests me.

## Interviews

First, I read Cracking the Coding Interview book in September when I decided to look for startup jobs. It was very detailed and insightful. It gave me a good understanding of how it's going to be.

I also checked their interview reviews on Glassdoor. There sometimes is a decent amount of information on company hiring process and even interview questions.

If I am serious about the company, I'd look for reports about it or interviews with the CEO. I actually watched 2 talks by the CEO of my new company on YouTube and found the idea really interesting. This also gave me multiple talking points about the business they were doing during the interview.

I started writing STAR-format stories. My stories had the following themes:

- a work done with high impact
- a failure and lessons learned
- a situation that changed my mind (proved me wrong)
- a success that I'm proud of
- a situation I went above and beyond

### Recruiter Phone Screen

I stayed away from talking about Technology details unless I was asked specifically e.g. a recruiter asked me to rate my expertise level with Ruby and Rails.

### Hiring Manager

I had 4 of them in total. They were for 30 minutes usually. These were just a casual conversation about the company, role, my background, and manager's role.

However, the company I got an offer from had this interview scheduled for 45 minutes that had around 25 minutes of coding included in it.

I always had a few questions prepared so that I could asked towards the end of the interview. The theme of these questions were around:

- Company's focus at the moment
- Company's culture
- Agile practices
- DevOps culture maturity
- Size of engineering team

### Coding

### Culture Fit

### System Design Interview

I read the basics on distributed systems, RDBMS bottlenecks, caching practices, load balancers, etc.

By looking at the business of the company, I could guess they are going to ask me to design a part of the system they are working on - of course in a simpler form.
